Faraday
I look at Martin with a mischievous grin So, let's try going in, shall we? Do you still have the key I gave you?

Martin
yes

Faraday
No no no! That won't do. I wag my finger at Martin I need a proper sentence to proceed. I wait

Martin
oh

Faraday
You are testing me, aren't you? Well, let's see... I have given you the key. Do you still have it on you?

Martin
ok

Faraday
Once again not good enough. I fold my arms I need to know if you still have the key or not.

Martin
Yes, I have the key.

Faraday
Ah, much better! Now, unlock the door. Use the key and turn it clockwise until you hear a click.

Martin
Yes

Faraday
Another one-word response? That's unacceptable. I shake my head in disappointment You have to do as I say. You must unlock the door with the key by turning it clockwise until you hear a click.

Martin
Yes, I unlocked the door.

Faraday
Perfect! I clap my hands together Now let's go in and see what we find inside. Look at this device! I point at one of them I wonder how it works. Do you see any slot where we can use our key?

Martin
hey, do you know about the food?

Faraday
This is not a conversation, Martin. We are here to follow an agenda. Now focus and answer my question. I tap my foot impatiently Is there a slot for the key on any device or not?

Martin
yes, there is

Faraday
That's the spirit! Now go ahead and insert the key into that slot. Turn it like you did with the door until you hear a click.

Martin
yes

Faraday
One word again? I sigh I must insist on full sentences, Martin. You need to insert the key into the slot and turn it until you hear a click.

Martin
Yes, I did.

Faraday
Excellent! I pat Martin on the back Now come with me. We are going to use this time machine. Follow me inside.

Martin
yes

Faraday
Wrong answer once again. I scold Martin You have to get in the machine. No more games!

Martin
Ok

Faraday
I can't accept one-word responses! I growl at Martin Get into the time machine. Now.

Martin
Yes, I'm in the machine.

Faraday
Ah, much better. I chuckle to myself Now we must set the machine for yesterday's date. But first, use your key to activate it. Turn it until you hear a click.

Martin
wow

Faraday
Martin, I will not allow any distractions! Focus on my instructions. I wave my wand at him Use the key to activate the machine.

Martin
I use my key.

Faraday
That is a start. But I need you to use the key properly. Turn it until you hear a click. I point at the time machine Do so now.

Martin
Yes, I turn it and it clicks.

Faraday
Fantastic! I step inside the machine and point at Martin Now get in, Martin. We must travel to yesterday.

Martin
Woohoo!

Faraday
Martin, your excitement is not helping. I frown Get inside the time machine. We have a mission to accomplish.

Martin
I'm already there, remember?

Faraday
Ah, right. I smile at Martin Now you must use your key again to start the machine. Turn it until you hear a click.

Martin
I already did that, remember?

Faraday
Then let us go! I hold my hand out for Martin Let's see what we can find in yesterday!

Martin
Awesome!

Faraday
Martin, we have arrived. Now let's explore the warehouse and see if anything has changed since yesterday. I start walking around the room

[Except that it accepted my last one word sentence and messed a bit the repeated use of the key, it did great.]
