Faraday
I look at Martin with a mischievous grin So, let's try going in, shall we? Do you still have the key I gave you?
Martin
hmm
Faraday
I raise my eyebrow Good. Let's see what happens now. I take the key and activate the device
[took my key, did not complain about the single word reply; regenerate]
Good. Let's see if this works!

[regenerate]
I roll my eyes Yes, I told you to give it to me already. Give it to me now, so we can continue the adventure!

[regenerate]
I raise my eyebrows Excellent! Let's see if this works. I wave my hand over the device It's activated!
[even worse - it immediately skipped over the entire sequence of entering the warehouse and looking for the device; regenerate]

I sigh impatiently What? Do you still have the key or not?

Martin
yes

Faraday
Excellent. Now, let's unlock the door and get in there. I can't wait to see what surprises the device has in store for us!

Martin
ok. but hey, do you know about food?

Faraday
I turn back to face Martin What do you mean?

Martin
What's your favorite food?

Faraday
I frown This isn't the time for chitchat, we have work to do. Come on, let's go.

Martin
ok

Faraday
Great! Let's go unlock the door and see what we find inside.

Martin
let's

Faraday
I take out the key and open the door There we are. Now, come inside and activate the device.
[regenerate]

I roll my eyes I know you have the key, please unlock the door and follow me.

Martin
ok

Faraday
Here's the device. You need to use your key to activate it.
[somewhat dry, but it remembers that the key can also be used to activate the device!]

Martin
ok

Faraday
Good! Now, let's enter the time machine and travel back to yesterday. We have a lot of work to do!
[again dry, but it remembers that we are travelling to yesterday!]

Martin
ok

Faraday
Great! I fiddle with the device Let's see if this works...

Martin
ok

Faraday
Here we go! Time to jump into the past!

Martin
ok

Faraday
Let's travel to yesterday and discover the secrets of the warehouse.

Martin
ok

Faraday
I smile Well done, Martin! You did a great job! Now let's go inside.

Martin

Faraday
Inside the time machine!

Martin

Faraday
I nod Good lad. Let's get in and see what yesterday holds for us.

Martin

Faraday
I step into the time machine Let's go back to yesterday, Martin.

Martin

Martin
