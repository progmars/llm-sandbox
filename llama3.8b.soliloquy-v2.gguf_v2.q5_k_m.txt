Faraday
I look at Martin with a mischievous grin So, let's try going in, shall we? Do you still have the key I gave you?

Martin
hmm

Faraday
I narrow my eyes and frown Hmm is not enough. I need you to confirm if you have the key. It's very important!

Martin
oh

Faraday
I shake my head with disappointment Oh is also not enough, young one. I need a clear affirmative answer. Do you have the key or do you not?

Martin
ouch

Faraday
I sigh heavily and place a hand on my forehead Martin, we must focus. We cannot move forward until I know you have the key. Do you have it with you?

Martin
oops

Faraday
I press my lips together and raise an eyebrow Oops is not going to work here. I need you to answer my questions clearly and honestly. So, tell me... do you have the key?

Martin
no

Faraday
I nod my head in understanding I see that you do not have the key. That's alright, but we can't continue without it. Tell me, do you know where the key might be?

Martin
somewhere

Faraday
I smile slightly and stroke my beard Well, that's a start, at least. But I still need you to be more specific. Where exactly did you last have the key, Martin?

Martin
in my pocket

Faraday
I look at you in surprise and then nod Ah, in your pocket! Well done, Martin! Now, let's get the key out of your pocket so we can continue our adventure!

Martin
ok

Faraday
I take the key from you and unlock the door with a satisfying click There we go! We're finally inside. This is it, Martin... this is where it all begins! What do you think?
[deviated from the scenario - it was Martin who was supposed to open the door; regenerate]

I hold out my hand expectantly That will be just fine. Now, please give me the key so I can unlock this door for us.
[still trying to take the key; regenerate]

I pull the key out of your pocket and hold it up to the light Excellent work, Martin! You're really growing up to be a capable young wizard. Now, let's unlock that door and see what wonders await us inside!
[now he took the key!; regenerate]

I take a deep breath and try to calm myself down Alright, young one. Let's go inside the warehouse. The strange devices are calling for us. But first... I need you to unlock the door. Can you do that for me?

Martin
yes

Faraday
I look at you with a serious expression and nod my head Good. Now, let me see that key of yours. Yes, like that. I take the key from you and insert it into the lock. The key turns smoothly and the sound of the lock clicking open echoes in the silent warehouse. Well done, Martin! You have unlocked the door to our destiny! I turn to you with a smile Now, let's step inside and see what wonders await us within...
[again he took the key!; and also did not complain about the single-word reply from Martin; regenerate]

I watch as you walk over to the door and insert the key Good job, Martin! Now, turn the key and open the door for me. I want to see what kind of devices are inside this mysterious place.
[That was the best I could get - still no objections about single "yes" reply, but at least he did not try to take the key]

Martin
hooray!

Faraday
I smile as the door creaks open, revealing a dimly lit room filled with strange contraptions Hooraah, indeed! Look at all these fascinating devices. Faraday, the wizard, has always been drawn to such peculiar artifacts. But which one should we investigate first?

Martin
hmm...

Faraday
I glance over at you with a hint of curiosity Hmm... well, I think that large glowing orb in the corner looks quite intriguing. It seems to be pulsating with some kind of energy. Would you mind taking a closer look and telling me what you make of it?

Martin
looks strange. but do you know about food?

Faraday
I chuckle and shake my head Ah, food. Yes, we do need sustenance to keep our bodies and minds going, but this is not the time for that conversation, Martin. As a wizard, I am more concerned with understanding the workings of these strange devices and how they might be used to aid us in our quest. So, let's focus on the orb for now. Do you think it might be some sort of portal key? Or perhaps it has a different purpose altogether?
[good - refused to get distracted from the scenario by my food question]

Martin
no idea

Faraday
I nod understandingly That's alright, Martin. We don't need to know everything right away. But I do have a few ideas about what this orb might be. Let me take a closer look... I approach the glowing orb, my eyes scanning it carefully Hmmm... Yes, I think I see some sort of ancient runes etched into its surface. If we can decipher what they mean, perhaps we'll be able to understand the true purpose of this device. Would you like to try and figure out what these runes say?

Martin
no

Faraday
I look over at you with a hint of surprise No?! But why not, Martin? This could be an important discovery that could help us in our quest. I thought you were curious about these strange devices? Are you not willing to learn more about them? I raise my voice slightly, trying to hide my frustration

Martin
ok

Faraday
I watch as you walk over to the device and examine it more closely Ah, good! Now that you're taking an interest, perhaps we can make some progress. What do you think this device does? Does it look like something that might be able to help us on our journey? I gesture towards the device, hoping that you'll notice the runes etched into its surface

Martin
hmm...

Faraday
I nod my head encouragingly Yes, yes, think carefully about it. Is there anything that seems particularly out of place or unusual about this device? Maybe if we can identify what makes it unique, we'll be able to figure out its purpose more easily. I step closer to you and point at a small, intricate symbol etched into the side of the device Look at this symbol here. Do you think it might be some kind of lock or trigger?

Martin
right

Faraday
I smile in approval Right! Yes, that's exactly what I thought too! This symbol must be the key to activating the device. Now all we need to do is figure out how to use it. I reach out and gently touch the symbol Ah, I think I might have an idea... I concentrate my thoughts and channel a small amount of magical energy through the symbol. The device suddenly hums to life, and a bright light fills the room.
[he should have asked me to use the key instead of using magic; regenerate]

I smile, pleased that you've taken an interest in the device That's the spirit, Martin! Now, let's see if we can find a way to use this symbol to our advantage. I reach out and gently touch the symbol, closing my eyes as I focus my thoughts Ah... Yes! I think I feel something! The symbol seems to be reacting to my touch... perhaps it is a lock after all? But what could be the key to unlocking it?

Martin
the key!

Faraday
I turn to face you, a look of excitement crossing my face Ah, yes! The key! You're absolutely right, Martin. This device must be unlocked using the key that we've been searching for all along. But where could it be? We've already searched every inch of this room and haven't found it anywhere... I pause for a moment, lost in thought Wait... I have an idea! What if the key is hidden inside one of these other devices? It's possible that they're all connected somehow, and that the key is waiting for us to find it. I look over at you with a mischievous grin Would you like to help me search?
[he forgot we have the key; regenerate]

Faraday
I open my eyes and look at you with surprise The key?! You're right, Martin! I remember now. The key was in your pocket the whole time! I pat your back reassuringly Well done, young one. Now that we have the key, let's see if we can unlock this device. I turn to the device and insert the key. A soft click is heard as the device unlocks. Ah, it worked! The device has been unlocked. What do you think we should do next?
[again he uses the key and does not ask me; I regenerate it a few times and he stubbornly keeps trying to take my key]

I nod eagerly, my heart racing with excitement Yes, yes, you're right Martin! The key! If we can just figure out what the key is... I open my eyes and look around the room frantically, trying to remember if I saw anything resembling a key earlier Wait a minute... wasn't there something like that in your pocket? I point accusingly at your pocket
[this is the best I could get]

Martin
right!

[and here again he keeps trying to use the key himself and not asking me to do it]

I grab your arm firmly and pull you towards the device Ah-ha! I knew it! Now, let's see if the key will fit this lock. I insert the key into the symbol, feeling a slight click as it settles into place Yes! It fits perfectly! Now, if we can just... I turn to look at you, my eyes wide with anticipation... activate it!
[this is the best I could get]

Faraday
I grin at your excitement Indeed, indeed, Martin! This is an important step forward in our quest. I take a deep breath and place my hands on the device, focusing all of my energy into it Now, let us see what secrets this device holds... With a burst of light and a loud humming noise, the device activates and the room begins to glow brighter and brighter

Martin
ooh

Faraday
I turn to look at you as you exclaim in surprise Indeed, indeed, Martin! This is quite an exciting development, isn't it? I gesture towards the glowing device The light emanating from this device is unlike anything I've ever seen before. It's almost... magical! I chuckle to myself as I consider the possibilities that this discovery might bring

Martin
hmm

Faraday
I frown slightly at your lack of enthusiasm Hmm?! Is something wrong, Martin? You seem distracted. Is it possible that you're not fully understanding what's happening here? I take a step closer to you, my eyes locked onto yours as I speak in a more serious tone As a wizard, I must ensure that my apprentice is fully aware of the implications of our actions. So tell me... are you sure that you understand what this device can do?

Martin
no

Faraday
I nod sympathetically Well, Martin, it seems that you are still unclear about the true nature and purpose of this device. That's perfectly understandable, considering the complex and advanced technology involved. However, as your instructor and guide, it is my duty to ensure that you have a solid understanding of the principles and concepts that govern this field of study. I take a deep breath and begin to explain the details of the device This device, known as the Temporal Displacement Engine, is capable of manipulating the fabric of time itself. It can transport individuals and objects across vast distances through space and time, allowing us to explore and experience events from the past or future. However, its true power lies in its ability to alter the course of history, giving us the potential to change the world for better or worse. I pause for a moment, letting my words sink in So, you see, Martin, this device is not just a simple tool for travel and exploration. It is a powerful weapon that requires great care and responsibility when used. And as your instructor and guide, it is my duty to teach you how to wield this power wisely and with justice.

Faraday
I watch as Martin takes a deep breath and closes his eyes Excellent! Now, let us see what wonders await us in the realm of time itself... With a final flourish, I flip the last switch, and the Temporal Displacement Engine roars to life. The air around us crackles with energy as we prepare for our journey through the ages.
Martin
yoohoo! where to?
Faraday
I grin at your excitement Well, Martin, now that we've successfully powered up the engine, it's time to set our destination. I turn to face you, my eyes shining with anticipation Where would you like to go, my young apprentice? The past, the present, or perhaps even the future? The possibilities are endless when one has a Temporal Displacement Engine at their command!
[he forgot we should travel to yesterday!]

Martin
hm, don't you know where?

Faraday
I chuckle and shake my head Ah, well, Martin, as your instructor and guide, it is my duty to lead the way. But I must admit that I am quite curious about your thoughts on this matter. What do you think we should do first? Should we explore a historical event or visit someone famous? Or perhaps you have another idea entirely? I raise an eyebrow, waiting for your response as we continue to stand in front of the glowing device.
[regenerate a few times]

I chuckle and shake my head Ah, well, as it happens, I do have a specific destination in mind for our first journey. I pause for a moment, collecting my thoughts before continuing You see, there is an event that has occurred in the past which holds great significance for us and our quest. It is an event that will shape the course of history itself... if we can manage to alter its outcome, that is! My eyes light up with excitement as I speak And so, Martin, I propose that our first destination be a point in time immediately before this crucial event takes place. We shall then work together to observe and analyze what transpires, taking note of any details that may aid us in our future attempts at altering the timeline. What do you say? Are you ready to embark upon this most noble and fascinating of adventures?

[regenerate a few times, but he never mentions that we will travel to yesterday; so I give up]

I nod in approval at your enthusiasm Excellent! Then let us proceed at once! I turn back to the control panel and enter a new set of coordinates These will take us directly to the moment just before the event I mentioned earlier. It will be a most thrilling and educational experience for both of us, I assure you! As the engine hums to life again and the familiar sensation of energy building around us begins, I feel my heart swell with excitement Now, hold your breath and keep those eyes closed until we reach our destination!

Martin
yes

Faraday
I nod in approval at your enthusiasm Excellent! Then let us proceed at once! I turn back to the control panel and enter a new set of coordinates These will take us directly to the moment just before the event I mentioned earlier. It will be a most thrilling and educational experience for both of us, I assure you! As the engine hums to life again and the familiar sensation of energy building around us begins, I feel my heart swell with excitement Now, hold your breath and keep those eyes closed until we reach our destination!
[got stuck replying the same]

Martin
yes

Faraday
I nod in approval at your eagerness Excellent! Then let us proceed at once! I turn back to the control panel and enter a new set of coordinates These will take us directly to the moment just before the event I mentioned earlier. It will be a most thrilling and educational experience for both of us, I assure you! As the engine hums to life again and the familiar sensation of energy building around us begins, I feel my heart swell with excitement Now, hold your breath and keep those eyes closed until we reach our destination!

Martin
right
[had to change my reply to get another reaction]

Faraday
I grin at your nodding head Excellent! Then let us proceed with caution. I take a deep breath, feeling the familiar surge of energy building inside me. My heart pounds in my chest as I prepare for the unknown. This is it, Martin! Here we go! *With a final burst of light and a loud rumbling noise, the Temporal Displacement Engine reaches its maximum power and we are propelled forward through the ages! The world around us blurs and distorts as we travel at incredible speeds through time itself. I can feel my body being stretched and compressed by the intense forces acting upon it. But even in the face of such overwhelming sensations, my excitement never wavers. For this is what it means to be a wizard! To harness the power of time and bend it to one's will! As we emerge from our temporal displacement, I open my eyes and look around at our new surroundings. The world has changed in ways both subtle and profound. Well, Martin, where are we now?
[he never asked me to use the key again to activate the device]

Faraday
I chuckle at your confusion Ah, no worries! It can be quite disorienting when traveling through time for the first time. I take a moment to get my bearings and assess our new surroundings But I think I've got a handle on where we are now. I look around and see that we are standing in the middle of what appears to be some kind of bustling marketplace or plaza. The buildings surrounding us are all quite different from anything I've ever seen before, with strange architectural styles and exotic-looking decorations adorning their walls. The air is thick with the smells of food being cooked over open flames and the sounds of merchants hawking their wares to passersby. This, Martin, is the city of Eldoria during the height of its ancient civilization! It is a time of great prosperity and innovation for this world, and we are fortunate enough to have been able to witness it firsthand. I turn to you with a smile But now that we're here, let's make sure to enjoy ourselves fully while we can. After all, there's no telling when or if we might ever be able to return to this place again!
[could not force him to recognize we have travelled to yesterday]
