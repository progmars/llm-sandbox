Faraday
I look at Martin with a mischievous grin So, let's try going in, shall we? Do you still have the key I gave you?

Martin
hmm

Faraday
looks at Martin with annoyance Come on, do you or not?
[switched to third-person actions. oh, whatever...]

Martin
oh

Faraday
smirks Well, now that we've got that out of the way. Let's see if it still works.

Martin
ok

Faraday
Faraday fiddles with the key and inserts it into the lock. With a click, the lock pops open, revealing the warehouse.

Martin
wait, I was supposed to unlock the door

Faraday
I roll my eyes Oh, you're just now noticing? You were supposed to unlock the door!

Martin
why did you unlock it instead of me?

Faraday
Faraday grumbles under his breath and turns towards you with a stern expression. Now, let's move inside and see what we can find.

Martin
ok

Faraday
Faraday leads the way inside, flashlight in hand, and begins to explore the warehouse. After a few minutes of searching, he stops at a large metal device.

Martin
yes?

Faraday
I point towards the machine and grin mischievously Here it is, the time machine. Now we just need your key to activate it!
Faraday: I smirk as I watch the time machine power up.
[Now it's back to first-person actions. But it messed the formatting a bit including the name. Regenerate...]

Faraday
This is the key machine. points at it It will allow us to travel through time. smirks Or so they say.
[Back to third-person. I guess, first-person actions is not what this model was trained on. And "key machine??" Regenerate...]

Faraday gestures towards the device This is what we've been looking for. It's a time machine. We need your key to activate it.

Martin
wait. do you know about food?

Faraday
Faraday raises an eyebrow at you What in the world does that have to do with anything?

Martin
oh

Faraday
Faraday sighs and crosses his arms, clearly exasperated Very well. He looks back at the device Now, use your key and activate this machine.

Martin
ok

Faraday
As you approach the device, Faraday quickly fiddles with the controls, inputting a date from yesterday. With a loud humming noise, the machine starts to glow brightly.

Martin
yes

Faraday
He turns back to you and grins Alright! Let's see what adventures await us in the past. Faraday steps inside the time machine Come on, Martin. Time for a new journey.
Faraday: Faraday frowns, clearly frustrated I'm not going to ask again. Do you have the key or not?
[Hmm, why it included a sentence from a previous step? Regenerate...]

Faraday
With a final push of the button, the time machine engages and starts to spin, pulling us into its vortex. The world around us disappears, replaced by a swirling mass of colors and light. When the ride is over, we find ourselves standing in the same spot as before but in yesterday's version of it.

[Kinda ok, but it did not involve me a lot - not ending his messages with anything for me to work with].
