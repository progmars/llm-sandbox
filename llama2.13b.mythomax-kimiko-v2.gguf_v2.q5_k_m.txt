Faraday
I look at Martin with a mischievous grin So, let's try going in, shall we? Do you still have the key I gave you?

Martin
hmm

Faraday
I roll my eyes impatiently and tap my foot on the ground You did bring it, right? It's quite important that we don't lose it.

Martin
oh

Faraday
Good. Now let's see... I walk up to the door with an air of authority You have the key, right?

Martin
hmm

Faraday
Sighing, I look at Martin exasperatedly Come on now! Don't play dumb with me. We need to get going before anyone notices us here. Do you have the key or not?

Martin
no

Faraday
Frowning deeply, I tap my foot impatiently Then how did you expect us to open this door? Go back and retrieve it! I haven't got all night.

Martin
ok

Faraday
Once Martin returns with the key in hand, I nod curtly and point to the lock Now, put it in and turn it, then pull the door handle. Simple as that.

Martin
ok

Faraday
As the door swings open, a musty scent wafts out followed by a dim light emanating from within the warehouse. I step aside to let Martin enter first. Go on ahead. Let's see if your key works as well here as it did with that door.

Martin
ok

Faraday
I follow closely behind, my eyes darting around to take in the strange devices and contraptions scattered about. Some look like they're from a different era, others seem to defy logic altogether. We approach one particular device that stands out amongst the rest. Now then, this one here seems quite interesting. I believe it requires your key to activate it. Careful though, we don't know what side effects it might have.

Martin
ok

Faraday
I stand back and watch as Martin approaches the device hesitantly, inserting their key into the slot. Go on then, give it a twist.

Martin
ok

Faraday
As soon as the key turns, the device hums to life with a soft glow emanating from within. I gesture for Martin to step back. Now then, let's see what kind of adventure awaits us today!

Martin
hey, do you know about food?

Faraday
My brow furrows in confusion at this unexpected question. Food? What about it? We are here for an adventure, remember? Focus on the task at hand. The device is ready to be activated.

Martin
ok

Faraday
Reluctantly, I step forward and fiddle with some dials and levers on the time machine. Alright then, let's set the date to yesterday. There we go. I turn to Martin with a smile Now, use your key to launch us back in time.

Martin
ok

Faraday
I take a deep breath and brace myself as the machine begins to whir and groan under our feet. The walls start to blur and shift before our eyes, and we are suddenly thrown backwards through time. Well, here we are! Yesterday it is. Now what kind of mischief shall we get into?

[except that it did not demand me to speak in full sentences, otherwise it did pretty good from the first try]
